        <h3>What is Tamil?</h3>
        <p>Tamil is ancient. 2000+ years of documented history. That's older than most European languages combined. While French and English were still evolving, Tamil literature was already flourishing.</p>
        <p>Today, 78.7 million people speak Tamil natively. Add 2.1 million second-language speakers? You get 80.8 million total. That makes Tamil the 20th most spoken language globally. Not bad for a language that's been around since before the Roman Empire.</p>
        <p>Most Tamil speakers live in India - 70.4 million in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. But the language spread globally. Sri Lanka has 6.5 million Tamil speakers. Singapore, Malaysia, Mauritius, Canada, UK all have significant Tamil communities. Tamil diaspora is worldwide.</p>
        <p>Tamil belongs to the Dravidian language family. Completely different from Indo-Aryan languages like Hindi, Urdu, Bengali. Think of it as the linguistic cousin of Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam. But Tamil is the oldest member of this family.</p>
        <p>The language has incredible cultural status. India declared Tamil a classical language in 2004. One of only six languages to get this honor. Tamil literature spans over 2000 years continuously. No breaks. That's remarkable. The oldest surviving Tamil work? Dating back to 300 BCE. That's before the birth of Jesus.</p>

        <h3>Tamil Writing System</h3>
        <p>The Tamil script is mathematical perfection. 12 vowels, 18 consonants, 216 compound letters. Total: 247 letters. It's an abugida system - each consonant has an inherent vowel sound that you can modify.</p>
        <p>Here's how it works: The letter "க்" (k) has an inherent "a" sound (ka). Add vowel diacritics to change it: "கி" (ki), "கீ" (kī), "கு" (ku), "கூ" (kū), "கெ" (ke), "கே" (kē), "கை" (kai), "கொ" (ko), "கோ" (kō), "கௌ" (kau). Ten vowel variations from one consonant.</p>
        <p>The script evolved from Brahmi. Like most Indian scripts. But Tamil developed its unique style over centuries. The script has remained remarkably stable. A Tamil speaker today can read thousand-year-old manuscripts. That's incredible stability.</p>
        <p>Tamil writing has no uppercase or lowercase. Unicameral script. All characters are the same height. Clean, geometric shapes. The script is designed for carving on stone - hence the angular, precise forms.</p>
        <p>Modern Tamil uses both traditional script and simplified versions. Traditional script preserves all 247 letters. Simplified versions reduce complexity for everyday writing. Both are valid, but keyboards typically support the full traditional script.</p>
        <p>The script is written left-to-right. Like English. But the characters look completely different. No curves like Arabic. No complex combinations like Bengali. Each character fits in an imaginary square box. Perfect calligraphy harmony.</p>

        <h3>Common Use Cases</h3>
        <p>You're learning Tamil? Excellent choice. 2000+ years of literature, classical poetry, modern cinema, growing tech industry. But typing Tamil on a regular keyboard? Impossible without help.</p>
        <p>Maybe you're doing business with Tamil Nadu. The state is India's tech hub. Chennai, Coimbatore, Bangalore nearby. Silicon Valley of India. 692 million internet users in India, with Tamil Nadu having some of the highest penetration rates (55-60%). That's a massive digital market.</p>
        <p>Or perhaps you're researching Tamil literature. Sangam poetry from 300 BCE. Modern Tamil novels. Academic papers on Dravidian linguistics. Most content exists online. But you need to type Tamil search queries. Online keyboard makes research possible.</p>
        <p>Family connections matter too. Tamil diaspora is global. Singapore, Malaysia, Mauritius have large Tamil communities. Canada's Toronto, UK's London have Tamil neighborhoods. Staying in touch with relatives in Chennai or Jaffna? You need Tamil text.</p>
        <p>Academic work is another big reason. Studying South Indian history, Dravidian languages, comparative literature. You need to type Tamil characters for research papers, presentations, translations. Online keyboard provides the academic tools you need.</p>

        <h3>Advantages Over Physical Keyboards</h3>
        <p>First: instant access anywhere. No installation, no downloads, no IT approval. Open your browser, start typing. Works on laptop, tablet, phone. Even public computers in libraries or internet cafes.</p>
        <p>Second: completely free forever. Physical Tamil keyboards cost money plus shipping. Keyboard stickers wear off, fade, leave residue. Online keyboards cost nothing. Always free. No maintenance.</p>
        <p>Third: visual learning advantage. You see exactly where each of the 247 Tamil characters is located. Physical keyboards require memorizing dozens of character combinations. Online keyboards show you the complete character map.</p>
        <p>Fourth: perfect character combinations. Tamil has complex compound letters - 216 of them. க் + க = க்க (kka). Online keyboards handle these combinations automatically. You select, it produces the correct conjunct form.</p>
        <p>Fifth: works with all Tamil fonts. Different websites use different Tamil fonts - Latha, Bamini, Anjal, Tab. Online keyboards produce Unicode text that works with any Tamil font. No compatibility issues.</p>
        <p>Sixth: mobile-friendly. Many Tamil users access internet primarily through phones. Online Tamil keyboards work perfectly on touch screens. Character layouts optimized for mobile typing. No physical keyboard needed.</p>

      level: 2,
      content: `
        <h3>Beginner Tips</h3>
        <p>Start with vowels first. Tamil has 12 vowels (uyir eluthukkal). Learn them before consonants. அ (a), ஆ (ā), இ (i), ஈ (ī), உ (u), ഊ (ū), എ (e), ഏ (ē), ഐ (ai), ഒ (o), ഓ (ō), ഔ (au). Master these vowel sounds and shapes.</p>
        <p>Practice basic words. "வணக்கம்" (vandagam - welcome), "நன்றி" (nandri - thank you), "வணக்கம்" (vandagam - hello). These common phrases teach vowel-consonant combinations. Type them repeatedly until your fingers remember.</p>
        <p>Use the visual keyboard initially. Click each character with your mouse. Watch how vowel diacritics attach to consonants. Notice how compound letters form. This builds visual recognition and muscle memory.</p>
        <p>Focus on consonant next. 18 consonants (mey eluthukkal). Start with the most common ones: க (ka), ச (ca), ட (ṭa), த (ta), ப (pa), ர (ra). These appear constantly in Tamil writing.</p>
        <p>Don't worry about speed initially. Accuracy matters more. Tamil has characters that look similar but represent different sounds. ர (ra) versus ற (ṟa). Small differences, big impact. Get them right, then build speed gradually.</p>

        <h3>Advanced Techniques</h3>
        <p>Master compound letters (uyirmei eluthukkal). There are 216 possible combinations. Learn the most common ones first: க்க (kka), த்த (tta), ப்ப (ppa), க்ஷ (kṣa), ஸ்ர (sra). These appear constantly in Tamil text.</p>
        <p>Learn phonetic typing methods. Most Tamil keyboards use phonetic mapping. Type "nandri" to get "நன்றி". Type "vandagam" to get "வணக்கம்". Find which phonetic system your online keyboard uses and master it.</p>
        <p>Practice with real Tamil content. Copy short Tamil articles, social media posts, song lyrics from Kollywood movies. Type them out. Compare your version with the original. This builds practical skills and exposes you to natural language patterns.</p>
        <p>Learn Tamil-specific typing rules. Certain character combinations behave differently. "ஸ்" + "ர" = "ஸ்ர" (sra). "க்" + "ஷ" = "க்ஷ" (kṣa). These rules ensure accurate compound letter formation.</p>
        <p>Use online Tamil dictionaries. Many show word breakdowns, pronunciation guides, example sentences. Tools like Agarathi, online Tamil-English dictionaries help you understand how Tamil words form and which characters commonly appear together.</p>

        <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
        <p>Don't confuse similar-looking characters. ர (ra) and ற (ṟa) look similar but represent different sounds. ழ (ḻa) and ள (ḷa) are another confusing pair. Learn to spot the subtle differences in character shapes.</p>
        <p>Don't forget the pulli (dot). Tamil consonants have a dot (pulli) when they appear without vowels. "க" (ka) versus "க்" (k). Missing or adding the pulli changes word meaning completely. Don't skip it thinking people will understand.</p>
        <p>Don't ignore compound letter rules. Tamil doesn't just stack consonants randomly. Specific combinations create specific compound letters. Learning these rules prevents writing errors and improves typing accuracy.</p>
        <p>Don't mix different typing systems. Stick to one phonetic mapping consistently. Different Tamil keyboards might use slightly different mappings for the same sounds. Find one system and master it before trying others.</p>
        <p>Don't rely entirely on transliteration. While helpful initially, direct Tamil character selection is faster and more accurate. Use transliteration as a learning tool, not a permanent typing method.</p>

        <p>Tamil has 78.7 million native speakers worldwide. That makes it the 20th most spoken language globally by native speakers. Add 2.1 million second-language speakers, you get 80.8 million total speakers worldwide.</p>
        <p>India hosts the vast majority - 70.4 million Tamil speakers. Most concentrated in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. But Tamil diaspora is global. Sri Lanka has 6.5 million speakers, making it the second-largest Tamil-speaking population.</p>
        <p>The Tamil script is mathematically elegant. 247 characters total: 12 vowels, 18 consonants, 216 compound letters. Each consonant can combine with each vowel, plus have inherent vowel sounds. The system allows for every possible sound in the language.</p>
        <p>Tamil's historical significance is remarkable. Documented history spans over 2000 years. The oldest surviving Tamil work dates back to 300 BCE. That's before the Roman Empire reached its height. Tamil literature has been written continuously for over two millennia.</p>
        <p>India recognized Tamil's cultural importance by declaring it a classical language in 2004. One of only six languages to receive this honor. The designation recognizes Tamil's ancient literary tradition and cultural contributions.</p>
        <p>Digital transformation is happening fast in Tamil regions. India has 692 million internet users as of 2024 (47.6% penetration). Tamil Nadu specifically has 55-60% internet penetration, among the highest in India. Digital content creation in Tamil is growing rapidly.</p>
        <p>Tamil diaspora communities maintain strong language connections worldwide. Significant populations in Singapore, Malaysia, Mauritius, Canada, UK, USA. These communities actively create Tamil digital content, maintain cultural traditions, and teach Tamil to new generations.</p>
        <p>The Tamil script has remained remarkably stable. A modern Tamil speaker can read manuscripts written 1000 years ago. This script stability is rare among world languages and helps preserve cultural continuity across centuries.</p>

      content: `
        <h3>Can I type Tamil on my regular keyboard?</h3>
        <p>Yes, but you need to enable Tamil input in your system settings. Windows, Mac, and Linux all support Tamil input methods. However, you won't see Tamil characters on your physical keys. You'll need to memorize character positions or use keyboard stickers. Online Tamil keyboards show you exactly where each of the 247 Tamil characters is located, making learning much easier for beginners.</p>

        <h3>What's the difference between ர and ற?</h3>
        <p>These are different Tamil consonants with different sounds. "ர" (ra) represents the alveolar tap 'r' sound (like the 'tt' in American English "butter"). "ற" (ṟa) represents the retroflex flap 'ṟ' sound (made by curling the tongue back). They look similar but produce distinctly different phonetic sounds in Tamil words.</p>

        <h3>How do I type compound letters like க்ஷ?</h3>
        <p>Most Tamil typing systems handle this automatically. For "க்ஷ" (kṣa), you might type "ksha" or use specific key combinations. Many online Tamil keyboards provide direct access to common compound letters through the virtual keyboard interface. The software combines "க்" (k) + "ஷ" (ṣa) automatically to form "க்ஷ".</p>

        <h3>What is the pulli (dot) in Tamil?</h3>
        <p>The pulli (புள்ளி) is a dot placed above or below Tamil consonants to indicate that the inherent vowel sound is suppressed. For example, "க" (ka) becomes "க்" (k) with the pulli. This dot is crucial for correct Tamil writing - missing or adding the pulli completely changes word meaning and grammatical structure.</p>

        <h3>Do I need to install anything?</h3>
        <p>Nope. Our online Tamil keyboard runs entirely in your browser. Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge. Desktop or mobile. Just visit the page and start typing. Your text auto-saves in your browser. Come back later, it's still there. No installation, no downloads, no commitment required.</p>
