        <h3>What is Japanese?</h3>
        <p>Japanese is spoken by about 125 million people. Almost all of them live in Japan. That's what makes Japanese unique. It's the most geographically concentrated major language on Earth.</p>
        <p>Think of it this way: if you gathered all Japanese speakers in one place, they'd fit inside Japan. No other major language works like that. Spanish speakers live in 20+ countries. English speakers span the globe. But Japanese? Nearly 100% concentration in one island nation.</p>
        <p>Japanese ranks around 9th to 13th among world languages by total speakers. Not bad for a language stuck on an island, right?</p>
        <p>Here's something cool: Japanese has no proven relationship to other languages. Linguists can't agree on its family tree. Korean shares some similarities. But they're probably not related. Japanese stands alone. It's a language island in more ways than one.</p>
        <p>Japan technically has no official language. Wild, right? But Japanese is the de facto national language. Everyone speaks it. All government business uses it. Schools teach it. It's official without being officially official.</p>
        <p>One tiny exception: Angaur island in Palau lists Japanese as an official language. Leftover from when Japan ruled Palau. Though basically nobody there speaks Japanese anymore.</p>

        <h3>The Japanese Writing System: Three Scripts Walk Into a Bar...</h3>
        <p>Buckle up. Japanese uses three completely different writing systems at the same time. Hiragana. Katakana. Kanji. All mixed together in the same sentence. It's like writing English with Greek letters and Chinese characters simultaneously.</p>
        <p>Hiragana has 46 basic characters. These are curvy, flowing symbols. Japanese kids learn hiragana first. It's used for native Japanese words and grammatical particles. Think of it as the foundation script.</p>
        <p>Katakana also has 46 basic characters. These are angular, sharp symbols. Same sounds as hiragana, different shapes. Katakana writes foreign words, emphasis, and technical terms. Like "computer" (コンピュータ) or "coffee" (コーヒー).</p>
        <p>Then there's Kanji. Oh boy. Kanji are Chinese characters adopted into Japanese over 1,500 years ago. Total Kanji characters? Over 50,000 exist. Don't panic. Japanese schools teach 2,136 essential Kanji. Master those and you can read newspapers and books.</p>
        <p>Here's the crazy part: about 2,000 Kanji represent over 95% of characters in actual written text. So you don't need all 50,000. Just the common ones.</p>
        <p>Why three systems? Historical accident. Japanese existed as a spoken language with no writing. Then Japanese scholars discovered Chinese characters. They borrowed Kanji for meaning. But Kanji couldn't express Japanese grammar. So they invented Hiragana from simplified Kanji. Later, they created Katakana for foreign words flooding into Japan.</p>
        <p>Now Japanese mixes all three in every sentence. "I went to McDonald's yesterday" might use Kanji for "I" and "went," Hiragana for grammar particles, and Katakana for "McDonald's." This makes Japanese one of the most complex writing systems actively used today.</p>

        <h3>Common Use Cases</h3>
        <p>Let's get real. When do you actually need to type in Japanese?</p>
        <p>Maybe you're learning Japanese. Your textbook shows Hiragana and Katakana. You need to practice writing them. Homework requires typing Japanese answers. An online keyboard shows you where each character is. Click and learn. No guesswork.</p>
        <p>Or you're obsessed with anime and manga. You want to read Japanese Twitter. Follow Japanese artists on Instagram. Comment in Japanese on YouTube videos. Search Japanese Reddit. An online keyboard makes this instant. No setup required.</p>
        <p>Perhaps you're planning a trip to Tokyo, Osaka, or Kyoto. You need to book hotels with Japanese websites. Send emails to Japanese tour guides. Write messages to Airbnb hosts. Show respect by using their language. Builds trust fast.</p>
        <p>Business is huge too. Japan is the world's third-largest economy. You're negotiating with Japanese suppliers. Communicating with Tokyo office colleagues. Translating product descriptions. Professional Japanese shows you're serious.</p>
        <p>Social media in Japan is massive. 96 million social media users. Instagram grew 21.3% in one year. LINE messaging reaches 83.4% of internet users. If you want Japanese audience engagement, you must write in Japanese. English won't cut it.</p>
        <p>The JLPT test is another big reason. That's the Japanese Language Proficiency Test. 788,000 people take it yearly. Studying requires typing Japanese. Practicing writing requires Japanese input. Online keyboards help you prepare without buying special equipment.</p>

        <h3>Advantages Over Physical Keyboards</h3>
        <p>Why choose virtual over physical Japanese keyboards?</p>
        <p>First: instant access. No downloads. No installations. No driver updates. No compatibility issues. Open your browser. Start typing. Works on Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook. Even works on tablets and phones. Any device, anywhere.</p>
        <p>Second: it's completely free. Physical Japanese keyboards cost $40-60. Keyboard stickers cost $10-15. Plus shipping time. Plus potential customs fees. Why spend money when you can type for free right now?</p>
        <p>Third: visual learning. You see exactly which key produces which character. Hiragana clearly labeled. Katakana shown. Common Kanji displayed. Your brain learns through visual association. Much faster than memorizing invisible key positions.</p>
        <p>Fourth: no physical clutter. Japanese stickers on keyboards look messy. They peel off after months. Leave sticky residue. Make your keyboard look unprofessional. Online keyboards keep your physical keyboard clean and normal.</p>
        <p>Fifth: flexibility for learners. You're not fluent yet. You only need Japanese occasionally. Maybe once a week for class. Maybe twice a month for hobby projects. Why dedicate physical keyboard space to something you use rarely? Online keyboards appear when needed. Disappear when not.</p>
        <p>Sixth: multiple input methods. Online keyboards often support multiple input systems. Romaji input (typing "ka" produces か). Direct kana selection. Kanji conversion suggestions. Physical keyboards lock you into one method. Online keyboards give you options.</p>

        <h3>Beginner Tips</h3>
        <p>Start simple. Learn Hiragana first. All 46 characters. Don't rush. Take one week. Practice five characters per day. By day 10, you'll know them all.</p>
        <p>Use the visual keyboard heavily at first. Click each Hiragana character. Watch it appear. Your eyes connect the shape to the sound. This visual memory sticks better than abstract memorization.</p>
        <p>Practice common words. "Hello" (こんにちは), "Thank you" (ありがとう), "Goodbye" (さようなら). These use different Hiragana combinations. Type them repeatedly. Your fingers learn the patterns.</p>
        <p>Don't worry about Kanji yet. Seriously. Hiragana can write anything in Japanese. Kanji makes reading faster and clearer. But beginners can survive on Hiragana alone. Master Hiragana first. Add Kanji later.</p>
        <p>Use Romaji input if your keyboard supports it. Type "ko-n-ni-chi-wa" and it converts to こんにちは. This bridges English and Japanese. You don't need to memorize Japanese key positions immediately. Your English typing speed transfers over.</p>

        <h3>Advanced Techniques</h3>
        <p>Ready to level up? Time for speed.</p>
        <p>Learn the Japanese keyboard layout. It's based on QWERTY but different. The あ (a) row sits where QWERTY has numbers. The か (ka) row maps roughly to ASDFG. Practice until your fingers memorize positions. This unlocks true speed typing.</p>
        <p>Master Kanji conversion. Type in Hiragana first. Then press Space bar. A menu shows Kanji options. For "かんじ" (kanji), you'll see 漢字 (Chinese characters), 感じ (feeling), 幹事 (organizer). Choose the right one. This is how native Japanese speakers type. Learn it.</p>
        <p>Use predictive text. Modern Japanese input systems predict what you're typing. Type "おはよ" and it suggests "おはようございます" (good morning). Accept suggestions with Enter or Tab. This triples your speed.</p>
        <p>Learn katakana shortcuts. Many online keyboards let you type katakana by holding Shift while typing romaji. Or pressing a katakana mode button. Master this for foreign words. Coffee becomes コーヒー instantly.</p>
        <p>Practice particle typing. Japanese uses tons of grammatical particles. は (wa), が (ga), を (wo), に (ni), で (de), と (to). These appear in every sentence. Make them muscle memory. Your typing flows naturally.</p>

        <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
        <p>Don't type too fast initially. Japanese has look-alike characters. あ (a) and お (o) look similar. め (me) and ぬ (nu) confuse beginners. Slow down. Accuracy beats speed every time. One wrong character changes meaning completely.</p>
        <p>Don't ignore the small characters. ゃ (ya), ゅ (yu), ょ (yo) are smaller versions. They combine with other characters. きゃ (kya), しゅ (shu), ちょ (cho). Missing the small character breaks the word. "しょうがつ" (New Year) becomes nonsense if you type "しようがつ."</p>
        <p>Don't mix scripts randomly. Japanese mixes scripts, yes. But there are rules. Native words use Hiragana or Kanji. Foreign words use Katakana. Don't write "coffee" in Hiragana. Don't write "sakura" in Katakana (unless you're being stylistic). Follow the conventions.</p>
        <p>Don't skip Kanji conversion practice. Beginners often type everything in Hiragana to avoid Kanji. This creates unreadable text. Native Japanese readers expect Kanji. Practice converting Hiragana to Kanji. Start with common Kanji. Build up gradually.</p>
        <p>Don't forget punctuation. Japanese uses different punctuation marks. 。is a period. 、is a comma. 「」are quotation marks. 〜 extends sounds. Learn these. English punctuation in Japanese text looks amateurish.</p>

        <p>Japanese has 125 million total speakers. About 123 million are native speakers. That's 98.4% native concentration. Compare that to English (only 25% native speakers). Japanese is overwhelmingly a first language, not a second language.</p>
        <p>Japan's internet penetration hit 84.9% in 2024. That's 104.4 million internet users. Nearly everyone online. This makes Japan one of the most connected societies on Earth.</p>
        <p>Social media in Japan is exploding. 96 million social media users in January 2024. That's 78.1% of the entire population. Instagram grew 21.3% year-over-year. Added 9.8 million users in 12 months. TikTok surged 25.9%, adding 5.4 million users.</p>
        <p>The JLPT test had 788,000 takers in 2022. That number keeps growing. The test runs in 85 countries worldwide. Registration hit all-time highs in 2024. Why? Anime and manga. Global Japanese learning is booming.</p>
        <p>Speaking of anime: the global anime market reached $34.3 billion in 2024. Projected to hit $60.3 billion by 2030. That's massive growth. Over 800 million people globally watch anime content. Gen Z leads with 69% viewership, compared to 57% for millennials.</p>
        <p>Anime drives language learning. 86% of Japanese learners on Duolingo are under 30. And 70% are between ages 13-22. These are anime and manga fans wanting to understand content in its original language. Pop culture influence accounts for 63% of new learner motivation.</p>
        <p>Japanese writing is complex but manageable. Schools teach 2,136 jōyō kanji. Master those and you can read 95% of published text. The total kanji pool exceeds 50,000 characters. But you don't need most of them. Focus on the essential 2,000.</p>
        <p>Japan ranks as the world's third-largest economy. The e-commerce market alone hit $186.9 billion. This creates huge demand for Japanese business communication. Companies worldwide need Japanese-speaking employees.</p>

      content: `
        <h3>Can I type Japanese on my regular keyboard?</h3>
        <p>Yes, but it requires setup. Windows, Mac, and Linux all support Japanese input. You enable it in system language settings. Problem is, your physical keys still show English letters. You won't see Hiragana or Katakana characters. You'll type blindly or need to memorize positions. An online keyboard shows you exactly where each character is. Much easier for beginners and occasional users.</p>

        <h3>Do I need to install anything?</h3>
        <p>Nope. Zero installations required. Our online Japanese keyboard runs entirely in your web browser. Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge. Desktop or mobile. Just visit the page and start typing. Your text saves automatically in your browser. Come back later and it's still there. No accounts. No downloads. No hassle.</p>

        <h3>How do I type Kanji characters?</h3>
        <p>Type in Hiragana first. Then press the Space bar. A conversion menu appears showing Kanji options. Select the correct Kanji with your mouse or arrow keys. Press Enter to confirm. This mirrors how native Japanese speakers type. Start with common Kanji. The system remembers your choices and gets smarter over time.</p>

        <h3>Can I copy the Japanese text I type?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. Type your text, then click the copy button. Paste anywhere you need. Email, social media, documents, chat apps, search engines. The text is real Unicode Japanese. Works everywhere that supports Japanese text. Which is basically everywhere in 2024. Even works across different operating systems seamlessly.</p>

        <h3>Is this keyboard good for learning Japanese?</h3>
        <p>Yes, especially for beginners. You see each character visually. Click and learn positions. Practice Hiragana and Katakana without memorizing layouts. Perfect for homework, flashcard practice, and writing exercises. Combined with language learning apps like Duolingo, it accelerates your learning curve significantly.</p>
