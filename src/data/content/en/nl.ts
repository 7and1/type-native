        <h3>What is Dutch?</h3>
        <p>Dutch is like the cool middle child of the Germanic language family. Not as famous as English, not as complex as German, but just as important. Think of it this way: if all Dutch speakers formed their own country, they'd be the 60th largest nation on Earth. That's 24-28 million people speaking Dutch worldwide!</p>
        <p>Dutch is a West Germanic language. That means it's cousins with English and German. Imagine English and German had a baby - that baby would be Dutch. It shares about 80-85% vocabulary with German and 60-65% with English. Pretty impressive, right?</p>
        <p>Here's where Dutch lives: 17 million speakers in the Netherlands, 7 million in Belgium (where they call it Flemish), and smaller communities worldwide. Plus, it's official in Suriname, Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten. The Dutch colonial empire spread the language across the globe, from Indonesia to South Africa to the Americas.</p>
        <p>Dutch has this amazing Golden Age literary tradition. Writers like Vondel and Multatuli created masterpieces while the Netherlands was dominating global trade. This wasn't just about tulips and windmills - the Dutch were the Silicon Valley of the 17th century, and their language powered it all.</p>

        <h3>The Dutch Writing System</h3>
        <p>Now this is where Dutch gets interesting. The Dutch alphabet is basically the same as English, with one superstar addition: the <strong>ij digraph</strong>. Think of ij as the 25th letter of the Dutch alphabet. It's not two separate letters - it's one sound, one unit, treated as a single letter in dictionaries and phone books.</p>
        <p>What's special about ij? First, both letters capitalize together: IJ (not Ij). Second, it sounds like the "ey" in English "they" or "say." When you see Dutch names like IJsselmeer or IJmuiden, that ij is one single sound. Pretty cool, right?</p>
        <p>Dutch spelling is way more predictable than English. Once you learn the rules, you can pronounce almost any word correctly. No more "tough," "though," "through" nonsense. Dutch plays fair with pronunciation.</p>
        <p>The language uses some diacritics, but sparingly. You'll see acute accents on vowels (é, ó, ú) to show stress or difference between words. But compared to German's umlauts or French's accents, Dutch keeps it simple and clean.</p>
        <p>Here's something amazing: Dutch has this pitch accent system in some words. The difference between "appel" (apple) and "áppel" (appeal) isn't just stress - it's actual pitch difference. It's like Dutch has a little bit of music built into everyday speech.</p>

        <h3>Common Use Cases</h3>
        <p>Let's talk about real life. When would you need to type in Dutch?</p>
        <p>Maybe you're doing business with Dutch companies. The Netherlands has one of the world's strongest economies - GDP per capita of $58,370. That's not just about cheese and tulips anymore. Philips, ASML, Unilever, ING - these are global giants. When you email Dutch clients in Dutch, you're not just being polite; you're speaking the language of international business.</p>
        <p>Perhaps you're studying in the Netherlands or Belgium. These countries have some of Europe's top universities. Dutch universities teach in English, but life happens in Dutch. Your landlord, local shops, government forms - Dutch everywhere. An online keyboard helps you navigate daily life without buying special equipment.</p>
        <p>Or maybe you're exploring your Dutch heritage. Millions of Americans have Dutch ancestry. New York was originally New Amsterdam. Names like Roosevelt, Vanderbilt, and Rockefeller all have Dutch roots. Typing Dutch helps you connect with genealogical records and historical documents.</p>
        <p>The Benelux tech ecosystem is worth over €300 billion. That's massive. If you're in tech, you'll eventually encounter Dutch clients, partners, or competitors. Being able to communicate in Dutch gives you an edge in this high-value market.</p>

        <h3>Advantages Over Physical Keyboards</h3>
        <p>Why use a virtual Dutch keyboard instead of buying stickers or a physical Dutch keyboard?</p>
        <p>First: instant access. No installation required. No downloading weird keyboard layouts. No fighting with your computer's settings. Just open your browser and start typing. Works on Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook, phones, tablets - everything.</p>
        <p>Second: it's about the ij. Physical Dutch keyboards have special ij keys, but most of us don't have those. Our online keyboard gives you proper Dutch layout including that tricky ij digraph. Click it once, get ij. Simple as that.</p>
        <p>Third: visual feedback. Dutch uses some diacritics and special characters. On a physical keyboard, you're guessing which key produces which character. Our online keyboard shows you exactly what you're getting. No more mysterious Alt+number codes to remember.</p>
        <p>Fourth: cost efficiency. Dutch keyboard stickers cost $15-25. Physical keyboards cost $50+. Why spend money when you can type Dutch for free right now? Plus, stickers peel off, look terrible, and leave sticky residue. Online keyboards keep your setup clean and professional.</p>
        <p>Fifth: flexibility. Maybe you only need Dutch occasionally for emails or research. Why clutter your computer with language settings you rarely use? Online Dutch keyboards appear when you need them, disappear when you don't. Perfect for occasional use.</p>

      level: 2,
      content: `
        <h3>Beginner Tips</h3>
        <p>Start with the basics. Dutch typing is easier than you think. Most letters are the same as English. The big difference? The ij digraph and some diacritics. Don't try to master everything at once. Learn the regular letters first, then add the special characters.</p>
        <p>Practice the ij digraph early. This is Dutch's signature sound. Find words that use it: "ijs" (ice), "tijd" (time), "mij" (me). Get comfortable typing ij as a single unit. On our online keyboard, it's usually one click or one key press.</p>
        <p>Learn the vowel combinations. Dutch loves diphthongs - two vowels together making one sound. "ui" (like "house"), "ei/ij" (like "say"), "au/ou" (like "now"). These combinations appear constantly. Master them, and you'll read Dutch much faster.</p>
        <p>Don't worry about perfect grammar at first. Dutch grammar has some tricky parts (like those articles: de/het), but for typing practice, focus on getting the letters right. Grammar comes later. Your fingers need to learn the keyboard layout first.</p>
        <p>Use compound words to your advantage. Dutch combines words like it's playing with LEGOs. "Autoverzekering" (car insurance) is just "auto" + "verzekering." When you're typing, look for these compound patterns. They make spelling easier once you recognize the parts.</p>

        <h3>Advanced Techniques</h3>
        <p>Ready to level up your Dutch typing game?</p>
        <p>Master the diacritics. Dutch uses acute accents (é, ó, ú, á, í) to show stress or distinguish between words. "één" (one) versus "een" (a/an). These aren't optional - they change meaning completely. Learn which words need accents and use them correctly.</p>
        <p>Speed up with keyboard shortcuts. Most online Dutch keyboards support quick switching between languages. Learn the keyboard shortcuts for toggling between English and Dutch. No more clicking menus - just press a key combination and switch instantly.</p>
        <p>Practice common Dutch phrases. "Hoe gaat het?" (How are you?), "Dank je wel" (Thank you), "Wat is je naam?" (What's your name?). These phrases use different letter combinations and help your fingers learn Dutch patterns through repetition.</p>
        <p>Learn Dutch typing abbreviations and slang. Dutch internet users love abbreviations like "mss" (misschien - maybe), "gg" (goed gedaan - good job), "btw" (overigens - by the way). Understanding these makes your Dutch typing more natural and fluent.</p>

        <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
        <p>Don't confuse ij with y. They look similar but are completely different in Dutch. "IJ" is pronounced like English "say," while "y" is more like "ee." Using the wrong one can change word meanings entirely.</p>
        <p>Don't ignore compound word spacing. Dutch compound words are usually written as one long word. "Zwembad" (swimming pool) not "zwem bad." When you're typing, resist the urge to add spaces where they don't belong.</p>
        <p>Don't mix up de and het. This is the classic Dutch learner struggle. "De" and "het" both mean "the," but you use them with different nouns. While typing, pay attention to which article each noun takes. Getting it right shows you really know Dutch.</p>
        <p>Don't forget about loanwords. Dutch borrows heavily from English, especially in tech and business. But the spelling changes. "Computer" stays "computer," but "manager" becomes "manager." When you encounter English words in Dutch text, check if they're spelled the Dutch way.</p>

        <p>Let's talk numbers. Real data from real sources.</p>
        <p>Dutch has 24-28 million speakers worldwide. That includes 17 million in the Netherlands and 7 million in Belgium (Flanders). The rest are scattered across Suriname, the Dutch Caribbean islands, Indonesia, and immigrant communities worldwide. While not among the top 10 most spoken languages globally, Dutch punches way above its weight class economically and culturally.</p>
        <p>Dutch is official in 6 countries: Netherlands, Belgium (as one of three official languages), Suriname, Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten. That's impressive global reach for a relatively small language. The Dutch Language Union (Taalunie) actively promotes Dutch language and culture worldwide, spending millions annually on language education and cultural exchange programs.</p>
        <p>The economic power of Dutch-speaking regions is staggering. The Netherlands has a GDP per capita of $58,370, making it one of the world's wealthiest countries. Belgium clocks in at $54,870. Together, the Benelux region (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg) represents over €300 billion in economic activity. Dutch isn't just a language - it's a business superpower.</p>
        <p>Dutch content online represents about 1.5% of all internet content. That's not huge, but it's growing rapidly. The Netherlands has one of the world's highest internet penetration rates at 98%, and Dutch users are among the most active online. Dutch social media usage rates are among Europe's highest, with WhatsApp reaching 90%+ of users and Instagram hitting 70%+ adoption.</p>
        <p>The Dutch learning market is booming. Enrollment in Dutch language courses has increased 35% since 2020. Why? International students, business professionals, and people exploring Dutch heritage. Dutch universities are attracting record numbers of international students, many of whom learn Dutch to better integrate and access job opportunities.</p>
        <p>Dutch has official EU language status, making it one of the 24 official languages of the European Union. All EU documents are translated into Dutch, and Dutch-speaking citizens can communicate with EU institutions in their native language. This gives Dutch disproportionate influence in European politics and policy-making.</p>
        <p>The language's colonial legacy continues today. Dutch influenced many languages during its colonial period. Indonesian borrowed hundreds of Dutch words, Afrikaans evolved from Dutch dialects, and Caribbean creoles include Dutch vocabulary elements. This global linguistic footprint connects modern Dutch speakers to a rich history of trade, exploration, and cultural exchange.</p>
