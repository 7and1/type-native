        <h3>What is Thai?</h3>
        <p>Thai is spoken by around 70 million people worldwide. That's more than the entire population of the United Kingdom! Most Thai speakers live in Thailand, obviously. But you'll find Thai communities in the US, Australia, Malaysia, and Singapore too.</p>
        <p>Here's something wild: 67% of Thai speakers learned it as a second language. That's the highest percentage among all major world languages. Why? Because Thailand has many ethnic minorities. These groups speak their own languages at home—Lao, Karen, Hmong, Chinese dialects. But they all learn Thai for school, work, and official business.</p>
        <p>Thai belongs to the Kra-Dai language family. Never heard of it? You're not alone. This language family is mostly spoken in Southeast Asia. Thai's closest relatives include Lao (so similar they're almost mutually intelligible), Shan spoken in Myanmar, and Zhuang spoken in southern China.</p>
        <p>Thailand has been independent for centuries. Never colonized. This is rare in Southeast Asia. The result? Thai language stayed pure. Didn't get mixed with European languages like Vietnamese (French influence) or Indonesian (Dutch influence). Though Thai did borrow tons of vocabulary from Sanskrit and Pali because of Buddhism.</p>

        <h3>The Thai Writing System</h3>
        <p>Ready for your mind to get blown? Thai script has 44 consonant symbols. But wait—two are obsolete. So really 42 consonants. But these 42 symbols only make 21 different sounds at the start of words and 6 sounds at the end. Confused yet?</p>
        <p>Here's why: Thai inherited multiple symbols for the same sound from ancient Sanskrit and Pali. Think of it like having both "ph" and "f" for the same sound in English. Except Thai has this for almost every consonant. Knowing which symbol to use? That's the hard part. You just have to memorize it.</p>
        <p>Consonants are divided into three classes: high, middle, and low. Why does this matter? Because the class determines the tone. The tone determines the meaning. Same word, different tone, completely different meaning. Say "mai" with a mid tone? It means "new." High tone? "Silk." Falling tone? "Burn." Rising tone? "Not." Low tone? "Mile." Five totally different words that sound almost identical to beginners.</p>
        <p>Now vowels. Thai has 32+ vowel combinations. Vowels appear above consonants, below them, to the left, to the right, or surrounding them completely. Sometimes a single vowel sound needs three separate symbols. One before the consonant, one above, one after. Your eye has to jump around the word to read it correctly.</p>
        <p>Thai doesn't use spaces between words. Instead, spaces mark the end of sentences or clauses. Imagine reading English like this: "Thaiscriptdoesn'tusespacesbetweenwords.Spacesmarksentences." That's how Thai text looks to beginners. Advanced readers don't notice because they recognize word boundaries automatically.</p>
        <p>The Thai script came from Old Khmer script around 1283 CE. King Ramkhamhaeng created it. Before that, Thai was only spoken, not written. The script ultimately traces back to ancient Indian Brahmi script. You can see the family resemblance between Thai, Lao, Khmer, and Burmese scripts—all cousins from the same ancestor.</p>

        <h3>Common Use Cases</h3>
        <p>Tourism is huge in Thailand. Over 35 million international visitors came in 2024 alone. Maybe you're planning a trip to Bangkok, Phuket, or Chiang Mai. You need to book hotels online. Message tour guides. Check restaurant menus. Search for directions. All in Thai. Your regular keyboard can't help you there.</p>
        <p>Or maybe you're learning Thai. The language is getting popular. More universities offer Thai courses. Language learning apps added Thai modules. You need to practice writing. Complete assignments. Chat with language exchange partners. An online Thai keyboard lets you type without installing complex software or buying special equipment.</p>
        <p>Business is another massive use case. Thailand has the second-largest economy in Southeast Asia. E-commerce hit 1.1 trillion baht in 2024. That's $38.5 billion in online sales. If you're doing business with Thai companies, you need to communicate in Thai. Emails, contracts, proposals, invoices—all look more professional in Thai.</p>
        <p>Social media matters too. 71.1% of Thailand's population uses social media. That's 50+ million people. Facebook has 58.4 million Thai users. TikTok has 44.38 million. Instagram has 18.75 million. Want to reach Thai audiences? You need Thai content. Marketing in English to Thai customers? You're losing 90% of potential engagement.</p>
        <p>Don't forget education and research. Thai universities produce valuable academic content. Government websites publish official statistics. News sites report local stories international media misses. Reading primary Thai sources gives you information competitors don't have. But searching requires typing Thai characters.</p>

        <h3>Advantages Over Physical Keyboards</h3>
        <p>Physical Thai keyboards exist. But they're a pain to find outside Thailand. Amazon might have them. But shipping takes weeks. Costs $40-60. Then you're stuck with Thai labels on your keyboard forever. What if you only need Thai occasionally?</p>
        <p>Online keyboards work instantly. Zero installation. No downloads. No IT support needed. Just open your browser and start typing. Works on any device. Your laptop, tablet, phone. Even a borrowed computer at a library or internet café. The keyboard follows you everywhere because it lives online.</p>
        <p>Visual learning is better. Physical Thai keyboards show labels. But Thai script is complex. 44 consonants, 32+ vowels, tone marks, special symbols. Cramming all those on tiny keycaps makes them hard to read. Online keyboards display characters large and clear. You can see exactly what you're clicking. Your brain learns faster with visual feedback.</p>
        <p>Flexibility matters for occasional users. Maybe you need Thai once a month. Or once a week. Buying a physical keyboard makes no sense. It clutters your desk. Gets in the way. Online keyboards appear when you need them. Disappear when you don't. Perfect for casual or periodic use.</p>
        <p>Updates and improvements happen automatically. Physical keyboards never change. But online keyboards can add new features. Better layouts. Improved suggestions. Bug fixes. You always get the latest version without buying new hardware.</p>

      level: 2,
      content: `
        <h3>Beginner Tips</h3>
        <p>Start with the most common consonants. Don't try learning all 44 at once. Focus on these ten first: ก (go gai), ค (kho khwai), ง (ngo ngu), ด (do dek), ต (to tao), น (no nu), ม (mo ma), ย (yo yak), ร (ro ruea), ล (lo ling). These appear constantly in everyday Thai. Master them first.</p>
        <p>Use the visual keyboard initially. Don't try memorizing key positions yet. Click each character with your mouse. Watch how it appears. Notice how different vowels combine with consonants. Your eyes and hands need to build that connection before muscle memory kicks in.</p>
        <p>Practice common words. "สวัสดี" (sawasdee - hello), "ขอบคุณ" (khob khun - thank you), "อร่อย" (aroy - delicious), "ราคาเท่าไร" (rakha thaorai - how much). These phrases use different consonants and vowels. Type them twenty times each. Your fingers start remembering the patterns.</p>
        <p>Don't stress about tones initially. Yes, tones are crucial for meaning. But beginners should focus on getting the consonants and vowels right first. Native Thai speakers will understand from context. Add tone marks later once basic typing feels comfortable.</p>

        <h3>Advanced Techniques</h3>
        <p>Learn the Kedmanee keyboard layout. This is the standard Thai keyboard layout. It's based on consonant frequency. The most common letters sit on home row. Learning Kedmanee lets you type on any Thai keyboard anywhere—computer labs, offices, internet cafés. The layout stays consistent.</p>
        <p>Memorize tone mark shortcuts. Thai has four tone marks: ่ (mai ek), ้ (mai tho), ๊ (mai tri), ๋ (mai chattawa). They're usually accessed by holding Shift and pressing number keys. ่ is often Shift+1, ้ is Shift+2, etc. Check your specific keyboard layout. These shortcuts save tons of time once you remember them.</p>
        <p>Practice switching languages quickly. You'll often mix Thai and English. Technical terms, brand names, foreign names all stay in English. Learn the keyboard shortcut to toggle between Thai and English input. Usually Alt+Shift or Ctrl+Space. Smooth language switching makes you look professional.</p>
        <p>Use autocorrect and suggestions. Modern Thai typing tools predict words. Start typing a few characters and suggestions appear. This helps with spelling. Thai spelling is hard because the same sound can be written multiple ways. Suggestions show you the standard spelling. Accept them. Learn from them.</p>

        <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
        <p>Don't confuse similar-looking consonants. ก (go gai) and ค (kho khwai) look similar to beginners. So do ต (to tao) and ด (do dek). And ป (bo bpla) versus บ (bo baimai). One tiny detail changes the letter completely. Pay attention. Double-check what you typed. One wrong consonant can create nonsense or offensive words.</p>
        <p>Don't ignore vowel positions. Vowels go above, below, before, or after consonants. Wrong position equals unreadable text. The keyboard usually places vowels correctly automatically. But if you're manually combining characters, verify the position. "ก" with "า" becomes "กา" (crow). But if you put them in wrong order, it's gibberish.</p>
        <p>Don't forget the invisible vowel. Many Thai syllables have no written vowel. The consonant alone implies a short "o" or "a" sound. For example, "กม" (kom) has no vowel symbol but is pronounced with a short "o" sound. Beginners often add unnecessary vowels. Leave them out when they're not needed.</p>
        <p>Don't overuse spaces. Remember: Thai doesn't put spaces between words. Spaces only separate sentences or clauses. If you space after every word, Thai readers find it weird. Like.If.English.Had.Periods.After.Every.Word. It technically works. But it looks wrong. Follow Thai spacing rules for natural-looking text.</p>

        <p>Let's dig into the numbers. Real data from credible sources.</p>
        <p>Thai has 39.9 million native speakers. Add second-language speakers and you get 60-70 million total. That makes Thai roughly the 20th most spoken language globally. Not as big as Chinese or Spanish. But bigger than Polish, Ukrainian, or Dutch.</p>
        <p>Here's the unique part: 67% of Thai speakers use it as a second language. No other major language comes close to that percentage. Thailand has over 60 distinct ethnic minority groups. Each has their own language. But Thai unifies everyone. It's the common language for education, government, business, and media.</p>
        <p>Thai script uses 44 consonant symbols (42 still in use) that produce 21 initial sounds and 6 final sounds. It has 32+ vowel combinations. Five tones. Four tone marks. No spaces between words. Reading and writing Thai requires serious dedication. But 93% of Thais aged 15+ are literate. The education system successfully teaches this complex script to almost everyone.</p>
        <p>Thailand's digital landscape is massive. 63.2 million internet users in 2024. That's 88% internet penetration. People spend 9 hours and 20 minutes online daily. That's more screen time than sleep for many people. Social media penetration hit 71.1%. Facebook has 58.4 million Thai users (82.9% of the population). TikTok has 44.38 million adults. Instagram has 18.75 million users.</p>
        <p>E-commerce is exploding. Thailand's online market hit 1.1 trillion baht ($38.5 billion) in 2024. Growing 14% year-over-year. Projected to reach $58.5 billion by 2027. Shopee, Lazada, and TikTok Shop dominate. Thai consumers love online shopping. Creating Thai content for e-commerce is extremely profitable.</p>
        <p>Tourism drives massive demand for Thai language tools. 35+ million international visitors came to Thailand in 2024. Tourism revenue hit 1.8 trillion baht. China sent 6.73 million tourists. Malaysia sent 4.95 million. India sent 2.13 million. Russia sent 1.75 million. These tourists need to read Thai menus, signs, websites, and apps. Translation tools and Thai keyboards see enormous usage during tourist seasons.</p>
        <p>The Thai script has been in Unicode since 1991. Block U+0E00–U+0E7F. It was among the first non-Latin scripts added to Unicode. Today every major operating system, browser, and application supports Thai natively. No special fonts needed. Thai text works everywhere digital content exists.</p>

        <h3>Can I type Thai on my regular keyboard?</h3>
        <p>Yes, technically. Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android all support Thai input. Go to language settings, add Thai, and enable the Thai keyboard. But here's the problem: your physical keys still show English letters. You can't see where Thai characters are. You either memorize the entire Kedmanee layout (44+ characters) or stick keyboard stickers on your keys. Online keyboards solve this. You see exactly where each character is. Click and type. No memorization required.</p>

        <h3>Do I need to install software?</h3>
        <p>Nope. Zero installations. Our online Thai keyboard runs entirely in your web browser. Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge. Desktop or mobile. No downloads. No permissions. No account required. Just visit the page and start typing. Your text saves locally in your browser. Come back tomorrow and it's still there waiting for you.</p>

        <h3>How do I type Thai tones?</h3>
        <p>Thai has four tone marks: ่ ้ ๊ ๋. They usually appear as Shift+number combinations. The exact keys depend on your keyboard layout. On Kedmanee layout, ่ is typically Shift+1, ้ is Shift+2, and so on. Our online keyboard shows you exactly where tone marks are. Just click them. They automatically position above the consonant. No guessing needed.</p>

        <h3>Can I copy the Thai text I type?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. Type your Thai text, click the copy button, paste anywhere. Email, social media, documents, messaging apps, websites. The text is standard Unicode Thai. Works everywhere that supports Thai language. Which is basically everywhere in 2024. Your text will display correctly on phones, tablets, computers, and any modern device.</p>
