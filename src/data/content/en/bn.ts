        <h3>What is Bengali?</h3>
        <p>Bengali is massive. 273 million speakers worldwide. That's seventh most spoken language on the planet. More native speakers than German, French, or Italian combined.</p>
        <p>Here's where it gets interesting: Bengali is the official language of two countries. Bangladesh (obviously) and parts of India. In Bangladesh, 98% of people speak Bengali as their first language. That's 100 million people right there.</p>
        <p>India adds another 85 million Bengali speakers. Mainly in West Bengal, Tripura, and parts of Assam. Plus diaspora communities worldwide. UK, USA, Canada, Middle East. Bengali speakers are everywhere.</p>
        <p>Bengali belongs to the Indo-Aryan language family. Same family as Hindi, Urdu, Persian. But it's its own branch. Think of it like Spanish and Italian. Same family tree, different branches.</p>
        <p>The language has incredible cultural significance. Bengali literature won Nobel prizes. Rabindranath Tagore was the first non-European Nobel laureate in literature. The Bengali language movement in 1952 sparked independence movements. People died for the right to speak Bengali. That's how much it matters.</p>

        <h3>Bengali Writing System</h3>
        <p>The Bengali script is an abugida. Not alphabet, not abjad. Abugida means each consonant has an inherent vowel "a". Add diacritics to change the vowel. Think of it like advanced autocomplete for vowels.</p>
        <p>The script has 50+ characters in total. 11 vowels, 35+ consonants. Plus various diacritics and special characters. The full system has about 350 possible letter combinations. That's a lot to learn. But you start with basics.</p>
        <p>Bengali script evolved from Brahmi. Same ancient script family as Devanagari (Hindi) and Tamil. But Bengali developed its own style over 1000 years ago. Curvy, flowing characters. Beautiful calligraphy tradition.</p>
        <p>Modern Bengali uses two main styles:印刷体 (print style) and 手写体 (handwritten style). Print style is what you see online. Handwritten style is more flowing, personal. Both are valid, but keyboards use print style.</p>
        <p>The script is unicameral. No uppercase or lowercase. Same as Arabic, Hindi, and many Asian scripts. One case fits all situations.</p>
        <p>Bengali writing runs left-to-right. Unlike Arabic, Hebrew. Like English, but with completely different characters. The script is used by 270+ million people across multiple languages, dialects, and regional variations.</p>

        <h3>Common Use Cases</h3>
        <p>You're learning Bengali? Smart choice. 273 million speakers, rich culture, Nobel prize-winning literature. But typing Bengali on a regular keyboard? Impossible without help.</p>
        <p>Maybe you're doing business with Bangladesh. The country's digital economy is growing fast. 77.36 million internet users, 44.5% penetration. Social media reached 52.90 million people, growing 22.3% last year. That's explosive growth.</p>
        <p>Or perhaps you're researching Bengali literature. Tagore's poems, Bengali novels, academic papers. Much of this content exists online. But you need to type Bengali search queries. Online keyboard makes it possible.</p>
        <p>Family connections matter too. Bengali diaspora is huge. UK, USA, Canada, Middle East. Staying in touch with relatives in Bangladesh or West Bengal? You need Bengali text. WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram work better in native language.</p>
        <p>Academic work is another big reason. Studying South Asian languages, researching Bengali history, analyzing Bengali literature. You need to type Bengali characters for notes, papers, presentations. Online keyboard provides the tools you need.</p>

        <h3>Advantages Over Physical Keyboards</h3>
        <p>First: instant access. No installation, no downloads, no IT approval. Open your browser, start typing. Works on any device. Laptop, tablet, phone. Even the computer at the local internet cafe.</p>
        <p>Second: completely free. Physical Bengali keyboards cost money, plus shipping, plus waiting. Keyboard stickers wear off, leave residue, look terrible after a few months. Online keyboards cost nothing. Forever.</p>
        <p>Third: visual learning advantage. You see exactly where each Bengali character is located. Physical keyboards require memorization, trial and error. Online keyboards show you the map. Your brain builds connections faster.</p>
        <p>Fourth: no hardware commitment. Maybe you need Bengali typing occasionally. Why clutter your desk with a specialized keyboard you'll use once a month? Online keyboards appear when needed, disappear when done.</p>
        <p>Fifth: perfect character accuracy every time. Bengali has complex conjunct consonants, vowel diacritics, special characters. Online keyboards handle combinations automatically. You select, it produces the right form.</p>
        <p>Sixth: works with any application. Copy-paste Bengali text anywhere. Email, documents, social media, search engines. The characters render correctly on any modern system. No compatibility issues.</p>

        <h3>Beginner Tips</h3>
        <p>Start with the basics. Bengali has 11 vowels and 35+ consonants. Don't try to learn all 50+ characters at once. Begin with the most common 15-20 characters. These cover about 80% of Bengali text.</p>
        <p>Practice simple words first. "আমি" (ami - I), "আপনি" (apni - you), "ধন্যবাদ" (dhonnobad - thank you). These basic words teach you vowel-consonant combinations. Type them twenty times. Your fingers remember.</p>
        <p>Use the visual keyboard initially. Click each character with your mouse. Watch how vowel diacritics attach to consonants. Notice which characters appear together frequently. This builds visual recognition and muscle memory.</p>
        <p>Focus on vowel diacritics next. Bengali has 12 vowel signs that modify consonants. Learn the most common ones first: "া" (a), "ি" (i), "ী" (ī), "ু" (u), "ে" (e), "ো" (o). Master these before moving to less common vowel signs.</p>
        <p>Don't worry about speed initially. Accuracy matters more. Bengali has characters that look similar but mean different things. "ত" (to) versus "ট" (ṭo) versus "ঠ" (ṭho). Small differences, big impact. Get them right, then build speed.</p>

        <h3>Advanced Techniques</h3>
        <p>Master consonant clusters (jukto bôrno). Bengali combines consonants in special ways. "ক্ষ" (kṣo), "স্ত" (sta), "ন্ত" (nta). Learn these common conjunct characters. They appear constantly in Bengali writing.</p>
        <p>Learn keyboard shortcuts. Most Bengali typing systems use phonetic mapping. Type "ami" to get "আমি". Type "dhonnobad" to get "ধন্যবাদ". Find which phonetic system your online keyboard uses and master it.</p>
        <p>Practice with real Bengali text. Copy short Bengali articles, social media posts, song lyrics. Type them out. Compare your version with the original. This builds practical skills and exposes you to natural language patterns.</p>
        <p>Use online Bengali dictionaries and tools. Many show word breakdowns, pronunciation guides, example sentences. These help you understand how Bengali words form and which characters commonly appear together.</p>

        <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
        <p>Don't confuse similar-looking characters. "ত" (ta), "ট" (ṭa), and "ঠ" (ṭha) look similar but represent different sounds. Learn to spot the small differences. Mistyping changes word meaning completely.</p>
        <p>Don't forget vowel diacritics. Bengali writing is vowel-rich. Skipping vowel marks makes text hard to read. Many Bengali words rely on vowel diacritics for meaning. Don't skip them thinking people will understand.</p>
        <p>Don't ignore conjunct consonants. Bengali combines consonants constantly. Trying to write "ক্ষ" (kṣo) as "কস" (kosa) looks wrong and can change meaning. Learn proper conjunct forms.</p>
        <p>Don't mix print and handwritten styles. Stick to one style consistently. Print style is standard for online content, documents, and formal writing. Handwritten style is more personal but less universally readable.</p>
        <p>Don't rely too heavily on English-Bengali transliteration. While helpful initially, direct Bengali typing is faster and more accurate. Use transliteration as a learning tool, not a permanent crutch.</p>

        <h3>Can I type Bengali on my regular keyboard?</h3>
        <p>Yes, but you need to enable Bengali input in your system settings. Windows, Mac, and Linux all support Bengali input methods. However, you won't see Bengali characters on your physical keys. You'll need to memorize character positions or use keyboard stickers. Online keyboards show you exactly where each Bengali character is located, making learning much easier for beginners.</p>

        <h3>What is the difference between ত and ট?</h3>
        <p>These are different Bengali consonants with different sounds. "ত" (ta) represents the unaspirated 't' sound (like 't' in 'stop'). "ট" (ṭa) represents the retroflex 'ṭ' sound (like 't' in 'top' but with your tongue curled back). They look similar but produce different phonetic sounds and can't be used interchangeably.</p>

        <h3>How do I type conjunct consonants like ক্ষ?</h3>
        <p>Most Bengali typing systems handle this automatically. Type the component sounds in order. For "ক্ষ" (kṣo), you might type "ksh" or "kkho" depending on the input method. The software automatically combines the characters into the correct conjunct form. Online keyboards often provide direct access to common conjunct characters for convenience.</p>

        <h3>Do I need to install anything?</h3>
        <p>Nope. Our online Bengali keyboard runs entirely in your browser. Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge. Desktop or mobile. Just visit the page and start typing. Your text auto-saves in your browser. Come back later, it's still there. No installation, no downloads, no commitment.</p>
